# E-Commerce Platform sample (from YAML AaC)
This is a sample with Diagrams generated by C4InterFlow from **Architecture** in **YAML**. It is based on a fictitious E-Commerce Platform build using Microservices Architecture.

It is using the following C4InterFlow toolchain flow (**Business Processes as Code** coming soon).

![C4InterFlow - toolchain flow](C4InterFlow%20-%20toolchain%20flow.png)

## Architecture as Code
The **YAML** is written manually
- [AaC](Architecture/SoftwareSystems/)

## Diagrams
Diagrams are generated from **YAML** AaC for all **Scope**, **Level of Details**, **Types** and **Formats**.
- [Diagram files](Diagrams)
- [Samples Visualiser](https://c4interflow.github.io/architecture-as-code-samples-visualiser/e-commerce-platform/) ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

## Try it locally

1. Clone [C4InterFlow](https://github.com/SlavaVedernikov/C4InterFlow) repo
1. Open `Samples\E-Commerce Platform\Yaml` sub-directory under the directory where C4InterFlow repo was cloned to in the previous step
1. Edit `draw-diagrams.bat` file as follows:
    1. Choose one of the following settings
        1. To re-draw **all diagrams** (i.e. `.puml`, `.png` and `.svg` formats), set `redraw-all` to `TRUE` i.e. `set "redraw-all=TRUE"`
            1. **NOTE**: this may take several minutes
        1. To re-draw **only diagrams** in `.puml` format, set `redraw-all` to `FALSE` i.e. `set "redraw-all=FALSE"`
    1. Save the changes
1. Double-click on `draw-diagrams.bat` file to run it and make sure it completed successfully
