# Internet Banking System sample (from YAML AaC)
This sample, with Diagrams generated by C4InterFlow from **Architecture** and **Business Processes as Code** in **YAML**, is based on the samples provided in [C4-PlantUML](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/tree/master/samples) project.

It is using the following C4InterFlow toolchain flow.

![C4InterFlow - toolchain flow](C4InterFlow%20-%20toolchain%20flow.png)

## Architecture and Business Processes as Code
The **YAML** is written manually
- [AaC](Architecture/SoftwareSystems/)
- [BPaC](Architecture/BusinessProcesses/)

## Diagrams
Diagrams are generated from **YAML** AaC/BPaC for all **Scope**, **Level of Details**, **Types** and **Formats**.
- [Diagram files](Diagrams)
- [Samples Visualiser](https://c4interflow.github.io/architecture-as-code-samples-visualiser/internet-banking-system/) ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

## Try it locally

1. Clone [C4InterFlow](https://github.com/SlavaVedernikov/C4InterFlow) repo
1. Open `Samples\Internet Banking System\Yaml` sub-directory under the directory where C4InterFlow repo was cloned to in the previous step
1. Edit `draw-diagrams.bat` file as follows:
    1. Choose one of the following settings
        1. To re-draw **all diagrams** (i.e. `.puml`, `.png` and `.svg` formats), set `redraw-all` to `TRUE` i.e. `set "redraw-all=TRUE"`
            1. **NOTE**: this may take several minutes
        1. To re-draw **only diagrams** in `.puml` format, set `redraw-all` to `FALSE` i.e. `set "redraw-all=FALSE"`
    1. Save the changes
1. Double-click on `draw-diagrams.bat` file to run it and make sure it completed successfully
